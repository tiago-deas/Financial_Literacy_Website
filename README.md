# Financial_Literacy_Website
Project developed for the <i>PrÃ©-Startse hackathon</i> made by students in which the theme was "Financial Literacy". I created a website for people to start getting familiarized with some nuances of personal finance. On my website, I added a spreadsheet and two different calculators, along with educative content, to people start managing their own financial life and get away from any budget issues.

<h3>The homepage of the website is named "index.html". I will explain briefly the project in the following paragraphs.</h3>

I named my educational company as <i>G15 financial</i> because I believe it is a strong and appealing name.

<h1>Homepage</h1>

<p>I created a very clean layout and design for my website and decided to keep a very straightforward header taking into consideration the target users of the website, which are people with low-income and low education degrees.</p>

<h1>Calculator Page</h1>

<p>I created two calculators, a simple and a financial one. Both of them are opened through a modal window. That was the best way I found to save some screen space.</p>

<p>The normal calculator is opened after the blue button is pressed.</p>

<p>The financial calculator is opened after the green button is pressed.</p>
